Do you need to go to the [[library &lt;- left]] or to the [[cafeteria &lt;- right]]?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="time" tags="" position="338,48">It&#39;s the evening, it&#39;s always the evening. Around 8PM? Who knows, why would anyone care...

[[back -&gt;the silent corridor]] </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="library " tags="" position="188,367">There&#39;s plenty of people here. But no one minds each other, everyone is busy working. It&#39;s always midterm time at the library.

You go to the third floor and idly browse your favourite books. After a while, you remember all the unread books on your desk and stop looking for more. You go [[back to your office -&gt; the not so silent corridor]]. </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="cafeteria " tags="" position="485,362">The cafeteria is cheerful, people are working in teams, eating and hanging out with friends. You like it here, and you think you should use it more often. An idea that you only have when in the cafeteria, you&#39;ll forget this feeling the moment you walk out the door.

You stand in line to grab a coffee but soon abandon the idea, the line is too long. You go back to the [[corridor -&gt; the not so silent corridor]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name=" the not so silent corridor" tags="" position="396,664">There are two people arguing in front of your office. Their tone is tense and very loud. You *just* want to sneak in your office.

Do you ask them to [[move -&gt; argument]]?

Do you go to the [[library ]]?
Do you go to the [[cafeteria ]]?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name=" argument" tags="" position="650,725">&quot;Excuse me, I need to use that door&quot;, you say. The strangers suddently stop and look at you. There&#39;s a tense moment where you don&#39;t know what is going to happen.




They look startled by you, they say sorry and you are free to enter your [[office -&gt; office without coffee]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name=" office without coffee" tags="" position="818,708">You seat at yout desk, still sleepy, you cannot remember what was that you were doing.

[[Stare at the screen -&gt; computer screen]] and try to make sense of it.</tw-passagedata>
